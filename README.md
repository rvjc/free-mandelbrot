## The Magic Equation

Imagine a God creating the Universe just before the Big Bang. His
only way of controlling his creation was by imposing a set of
physical laws from which everything else would follow. Our world
may be chaotic, but it has a remarkable underlying consistency
when one considers things like DNA, plants and creatures.

Now imagine an infinite 2D universe created from a much simpler
set of laws. The Mandelbrot Set (named after Benoit Mandelbrot
defines one such universe using an exceedingly simple equation:

  Z -> Z * Z + C
  
When this equation is used in a certain way, it creates a world
full of exotic shapes known as fractals. The similarities with
our own world are uncanny. Bugs and sea-horses are only the tip
of the iceberg. If your computer was powerful enough, you could
zoom in forever and make facinating new discoveries. All of this
from an innocuous little equation! Who said Math was boring?
